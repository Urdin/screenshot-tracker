### Known issues

Looking for support for the following known issues:

- Ability to capture cookie/session and use in screenshot sessions
- True mobile device emulation (right now just the resolution/width is simulated)
- App is not working on Linux and Windows Operating Systems due to puppeteer and
  electron/chromium connection
  ([#8](https://github.com/nomadinteractive/screenshot-tracker/issues/8),
  [#11](https://github.com/nomadinteractive/screenshot-tracker/issues/11))
- Testing on Wimdows
- Testing on Linux
- Writing proper react component tests. Right now tests folder only contains
  tests from original boilerplate code. They are not in proper use.
